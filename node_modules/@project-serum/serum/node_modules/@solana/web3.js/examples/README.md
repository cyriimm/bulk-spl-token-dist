## Examples
Before trying any of the examples in this directory please populate the `lib/`
directory by running `npm install`.

Additionally most of the examples attempt to connect to a local cluster.  Start
your local cluster first by running:
```bash
$ npx solana-localnet update
$ npx solana-localnet up
```
